## About
 This is a repository containing experiments and tutorials related to different machine learning models.

 This repository is a scratchpad to test out some my ideas, and to learn and experiment with ML models. Feel free to copy and use the code for your purposes. However, I do not guarrantee its efficiency and/or correctness.

## Running the code  
 The code in this repository runs successfully in a Conda environment with tensorflow, pytorch, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and jupyter notebook installed. The full list of packages can be found in the file ```package-list.txt```.
